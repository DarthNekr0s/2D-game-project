# 2D-game-project 

this is a 2d fantasy game in development for game design cert

if you want to play, go to the [releases section](https://github.com/d3aths/2D-game-project/releases/tag/0.1) and download the zip that contains game data files.

best played in smaller resolution *(recommend 640 x 400)* to avoid some yuck graphic issues with the grass in some places. you can use higher if you want but itll look worse due to the nature of the graphics. using resolutions that aren't widescreen will make the dialog box placements a bit wonky.
