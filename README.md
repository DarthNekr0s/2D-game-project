# 2D-game-project 

this is a 2d fantasy game in development for game design cert

if you want to play, go to the [releases section](https://github.com/d3aths/2D-game-project/releases/tag/0.1) and download the zip that contains game data files.

the folder 'fantasy game' contains all the games files to be opened with Unity.

best played in smaller resolution (recommend 640 x 400) to avoid some yuck graphic issues with the grass in some places. you can use higher if you want but itll look worse. using resolutions that aren't widescreen will make the dialog box placements a bit wonky.
